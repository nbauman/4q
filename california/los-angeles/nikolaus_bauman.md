# Nikolaus Bauman
Lead Developer and Founder at Foodzie.com - Los Angeles, CA


## 1. What are you working on right now (your full time job... side projects... anything and everything)?
Ecommerce: Every developer's favorite type of application! No really, it is one of my favorite types of businesses. Foodzie was started because we knew of lots of great food producers that couldn't get their products into the hands of customers that wanted them. As a company we've tried many different approaches to solving this problem. All were designed to be revenue generating on day one. Our most recent project, the [Tasting Box](http://foodzie.com/tastingbox) is a take on the "of the month club" business with a grandiose vision. I do manage to put some time into side projects, but none are ready to announce just yet.


## 2. What companies/projects have your worked on in the past?
My main job since graduating from college has been working on Foodzie.com. For all three years of Foodzie's existence I've been the main code contributor. I've built an ecommerce system from scratch, and I've also used multiple open source ecommerce frameworks (Spree and Magento). I use Ruby, Python, and PHP. I have yet to get into any native iOS or Android development, but it won't be long before I dive in.


## 3. What are you most proud of?
I'm proud of the work that I've done in the ecommerce space since graduating from college. Not only building out the features, but building a business and learning how to attract customers and keep them. Ecommerce has come a long way since it was created in the 90s. A lot of innovation has happened in the past four years. And now with mobile, there is a LOT more that remains to be created. Seeing my progression of knowing nothing, to what I know now (and what I know I don't know) is gratifying and humbling at the same time.

I'm also proud of how I think about engineering in a startup; it is very different. You have to be ready to throw things away. You have to be ready for things not to work. You have to be ready to change direction. Over the past three years I've definitely gotten much better engineering for uncertainty - but I still have a ways to go :)


## 4. What advice do you have for newcomers to your profession?
Have faith in yourself. There are many times when being a developer is discouraging. There are also lots of people that talk about efficiency of good programmers vs not good programmers. None of this matters. If you love solving problems, solve them. Solve as many as you can with whatever methods you can. The more you get involved the quicker you'll learn. Try not to let fear or anxiety hold you back. 

Also, [find a mentor](http://log.snikolha.us/post/4555203368/mentors). You are, or you become, what you do. So do something meaningful and do it a lot. Be experimental, take risks, and learn from your failures and successes.


## Bonus: Answer your own question: Are there enough web engineers in LA to support a healthy startup environment?
This is a question I hear asked a lot; [it's on Quora too](http://www.quora.com/Are-there-enough-web-engineers-in-Los-Angeles-to-support-a-healthy-startup-environment-in-the-city-of-angels). I have a multi-point beef with it. 

A.) There already is a healthy startup environment

>There are multi-"generation" founders that are a part of the community here. There is potential for more coordination and organization, but lots of companies are successful. Are they the same type as SF/Silicon Valley? No. They focus more on revenue because the investors aren't as risky, but there are lots of people with great industry knowledge down here solving huge problems. LA is very healthy, but very different.

B.) The question is super leading and without context. Every time it gets asked, more silly assumptions are made about LA (and also the valley/SF)

>It's like asking a candidate whether they are electable... they are if you vote for them, but not if you keep asking this silly question. No one can prove LA's viability through asking this question - but you can prove it through building great businesses.

C.) It often leads into a "can you scale your startup once you grow big"

>This last one is like planning how you walk on the moon before you know how to build a rocket. There are so many things that have to go right before you have to scale tech hiring in LA that unless you are a serial entrepreneur with successes already under your belt, you need not consider this question for a long time. Just get heads-down building a great business and focus on challenges as they come.
